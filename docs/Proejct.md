The project currently consists of three separate tools I previously developed. The first is an Anki AI Deck Translator: it infers the meaning of a card’s Front text from the existing Back text in the deck, then translates that meaning into the user’s chosen language. The second is an Anki Image Generator: it takes the Front text, generates an image-generation prompt appropriate for that text, sends an API request to obtain the image, and saves the resulting image into the Anki deck so the user can study with the image. The third is an Anki Sentence Generator: it generates example sentences based on the Front text words in the Anki deck.

My goal is to combine these three tools into a single program or add-on that can perform image generation, sentence generation, and Anki deck translation all from one place. The plan is to integrate everything into an Anki add-on. At present, the deck translator and the sentence generator already exist as Anki add-ons, but the image generator is implemented as an external CLI tool; this CLI must be converted into an add-on component. Your task is to analyze all three codebases thoroughly and produce a Markdown document that summarizes your analysis.

In addition to the code analysis Markdown, create a detailed development checklist for combining the three tools into a single Anki add-on. The checklist should cover code-level integration, required API interactions, data flow and storage inside Anki, UI/UX considerations for the add-on, testing and edge cases, packaging and installation steps for Anki, and any migration steps needed for decks already using the separate tools. When writing the documentation, please note that the existing code for each of the three programs is available in the 'Reference' folder—use those sources for your analysis.

You are permitted and encouraged to redesign the code structure or workflow where you find more efficient approaches than the current implementations. If improvements to architecture, performance, or developer ergonomics are possible, implement those improvements in the new add-on design and reflect them in the Markdown analysis and checklist
